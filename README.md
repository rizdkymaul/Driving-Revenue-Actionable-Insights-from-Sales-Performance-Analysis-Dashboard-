# SWOT Analysis
![alt text](https://github.com/rizdkymaul/Driving-Revenue-Actionable-Insights-from-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/img/swot.jpg)

`1. Strength`

![alt text](https://github.com/rizdkymaul/Driving-Revenue-Actionable-Insights-from-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-/blob/main/img/strength.jpg)

● Dominance of the "Robots" Category

The "Robots" category has the highest total sales, followed closely by the "Drones" category, reflecting strong demand and market appeal. This serves as a key driver of overall sales performance.

● Balanced Focus on Total Sales and Order Quantity

The "Drone Kits," "Training Videos," and "eBooks" categories also show significant order quantities, even though their total sales are not as high as those of the "Robots" category. This indicates potential opportunities to increase sales in these categories with the right marketing strategies.

● Affordable Yet Profitable

The "Training Videos" and "Blueprints" categories have lower total sales but outperform other categories in order quantity. This indicates a strong potential to boost sales in these categories through promotions or the development of more appealing products.

`Actionable Insight`

Develop a bundling strategy that combines products from the "Robots" category with "Drones" and "Training Videos." Offer attractive package deals that provide added value to customers, such as discounts on bundled purchases. This approach will not only drive sales in lower-performing categories but also strengthen customer loyalty and encourage repeat purchases.

`2. Weaknesses`

● Product Offering Diversification

The "Robots" category dominates sales revenue. While this is a positive aspect, it should be approached with caution, especially given the decline in sales from 2020 to 2021. This decrease could have a significant impact on the company's revenue. Therefore, it is essential to focus on other categories. This year, we can intensify promotions or campaigns for the "Drones" category, which has shown potential to offset the revenue decline from the "Robots" category.

`Actionable Insight`

Focus on product offering diversification by enhancing promotions and campaigns for the "Drones" category. Design engaging marketing strategies, such as special discounts or product bundling, to capture customer attention and offset the revenue decline from the "Robots" category.

● Strong Correlation with eBooks and Blueprints

There is a strong relationship between the "eBooks" and "Blueprints" categories with "Robots" and "Drones." This is evident from the sales characteristics of the "eBooks" and "Blueprints" categories, where the products are books and blueprints that have titles related to robots and drones.

● Customer Purchasing Patterns Across Diverse Products

It is observed that customer psherrot made 4 transactions with a variety of products, specifically "Robots" and "Blueprints," while customer sdixceekl made 7 transactions with a broader range of products, including "eBooks," "Training Videos," and "Drones Kits."

`Actionable Insight`

Develop effective cross-selling and upselling strategies with SEO-based product recommendations on the e-commerce platform and through email marketing campaigns. Additionally, create attractive bundling packages for new customers purchasing products in the "Robots" and "Drones" categories. Offer appealing options when bundling with products from the "eBooks" and "Blueprints" categories, such as discounts or bonus packages. This approach will enhance the shopping experience for our customers and increase sales in the "eBooks" and "Blueprints" categories.

`3. Opportunities`

● Washington: The Best Distribution City

Sales distribution in the Washington area is excellent, showing the highest order quantity and sales for the company. This presents new opportunities for increasing the company's sales.

● Promising Cities for Expansion

Analyzing the distribution of order quantities between 100 and 200, with total sales ranging from $20,000 to $30,000 USD, cities such as Houston, Miami, El Paso, and Birmingham emerge as the most promising markets for sales expansion.

● Given the geographical spread of these distribution areas, it is crucial to leverage digital marketing for this sales expansion.

`Actionable Insight`

Leverage the Washington area to introduce new products. Additionally, optimize promotional strategies in cities with order quantities between 100 and 200 and total sales ranging from $20,000 to $30,000 USD, such as Houston, Miami, El Paso, and Birmingham. Design engaging and relevant marketing campaigns to capture the attention of customers in these markets.

4. Threats

● Utilizing Customer Loyalty to Stay Competitive

Customer sdixceekl has the highest loyalty score (7) but relatively low total purchases ($1,649). In contrast, customer hfaulconerby has a loyalty score of 6 with significantly higher total purchases ($9,666), while customer aduberryoq has a loyalty score of 4 with a more balanced total purchase amount ($7,670). This indicates that some customers with lower loyalty scores still contribute significantly to revenue.

` Actionable Insight`

● Gamified Loyalty Program

Create a gamified loyalty program featuring tiers, reward points, badges, and challenges. Integrate it with a mobile app for easy access and higher engagement. Offer attractive rewards and opportunities to redeem points for products or discounts.

● User-Generated Content & Influencer Marketing

Collaborate with customers and micro-influencers to encourage content creation around our products, which can enhance brand awareness and social proof.

● Exclusive Community for Top Customers

Establish an exclusive online community (e.g., Facebook group, Discord) or offline events for top customers. Provide exclusive access to content, new products, and opportunities to interact with the company. This will foster loyalty and brand advocacy.
